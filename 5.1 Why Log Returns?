Log returns can be interpreted as continuously compounded returns.
Log returns are time-additive. The multi-period log return is simply the sum of single period log returns.
The use of log returns prevents security prices from becoming negative in models of security returns.
For many purposes, log returns of a security can be reasonably modeled as distributed according to a normal distribution.
When returns and log returns are small (their absolute values are much less than 1), their values are approximately equal.
Logarithms can help make an algorithm more numerically stable.
